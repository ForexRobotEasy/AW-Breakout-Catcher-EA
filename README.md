## User Guide

The AW Breakout Catcher EA is designed to trade breakouts in the forex market. It uses the previous high and low prices to calculate dynamic support and resistance levels. When the price breaks above the resistance level, a long position is opened. When the price breaks below the support level, a short position is opened. The EA includes stop loss and take profit levels to manage risk and exit trades.

### Input Parameters

- `breakoutPeriod`: The period used for breakout calculation. Higher values may indicate stronger breakouts. Default is set to 20.
- `stopLoss`: The stop loss in pips for each trade. Default is set to 50.
- `takeProfit`: The take profit in pips for each trade. Default is set to 100.

### Trading Logic

The EA's trading logic is implemented in the `OnTick()` function. It calculates the previous high and low prices, as well as the current high and low prices. It then calculates the dynamic support and resistance levels based on these prices.

If the Ask price (current price) breaks above the resistance level, a long position is opened. The stop loss and take profit prices are calculated based on the breakout price.

If the Bid price (current price) breaks below the support level, a short position is opened. The stop loss and take profit prices are calculated based on the breakout price.

### Customization

The AW Breakout Catcher EA code can be customized to fit your trading strategy. You can add additional indicators or trading rules to enhance the breakout catching strategy. Custom functions can be added to implement specific trading logic or calculations.
